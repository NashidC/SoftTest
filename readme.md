README

Hi, this file is how I want you guys to do this git stuff. It will include general things as well as things specific to this webstie project. 

Git Branches:
- this is the flow of how branches will go
     - master ->dev ->nashid [off dev create a branch called your name] -> nash_work [i highly highly recommend creating a branch off your branch as stated per meeting, however if you are extremely confident in your programming abilities this step is unecessary]

-once you guy are all ready with all your parts, please let me know so i can review it 
-this project is on you and the deadline is tuesday night
-i'm here to help you but i will not be doing the project until the absolute end 

-everyone is planning to meet tomorrow at some time. I will try to get us a brainstorming meeting and conduct that. I'll help the delegation of tasks but the ideas will be up to you. 


How to do it in terminal: 

1. Do the following commands
cd Desktop/FolderWhereYouWantThisProject
git init //this initializes the repository in your computer
git add . //this will add all of the files in your folder to the repo
git commit -m 'init' //init means initial commit 

2. go to github.com and create a repo [name it something simple] copy the link to the repo

3. more commands
git remote add origin https://github.com/repoName.git
git push -u origin master //if this doesnt work try just git push

git log //shows you your last few commits so you can make sure that you actually did it

next make sure to refresh your github repo website and check if it works 


Try to commit as often as possible! Or if you suck at doing that, at least at the end of everyday before you leave! 

Updating your repo:

1. navigate to the folder with "cd whereever"
2. git pull //always pull before you commmit
3. git commit -m 'i made this and this change' //commit messages are very important because you want to remember what you last did
4. git push //updates your master origin


DO NOT DO ANYTHING BRANCH RELATED YET UNTIL AFTER YOU ARE COMPLETED WITH THE GIT COURSE
